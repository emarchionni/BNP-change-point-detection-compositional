Title: 'Bayesian nonparametric change poin detection for time series of compsitional data'

Abstract:
A model to perform change point detection for compositional time series of any dimension is developed. The approach to address this problem is inspired to product partition models (Barry and Hartigan 1992), but in a Bayesian nonparametric framework, following the work of Martinez and Mena 2014. In particular, a suitably modified version of the exchangeable partition probability function arising from Pitman-Yor process acts as cohesion function of the PPM and data are assumed to be realization of the Wright-Fisher process, which presents the Dirichlet distribution as invariant distribution. As in PPM, both the number of change points and their location are object of inference. The main contribution of this work is being able to perform change point detection on compositional time series avoiding mapping them to real spaces though some transformation. Sampling relies on a split & merge MCMC algorithm.
